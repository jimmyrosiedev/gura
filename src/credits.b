This brainfuck file was added there just for fun,
so github will tell that this piece of software is written in Rust... and brainfuck
but i don't really want to just make this file a useless piece of bytes,
so the purpose of this file is to let every developer who contributed to this project write his name in this .b file
and leave any message developer wants.
I'll go first
